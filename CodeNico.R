# First Assignment - File 1
# ===============

### 1. Working directory and R packages
setwd ('/Users/Nico/Documents/FirstAssignment')

# In case you do not have the ggplot2 and magrittr packages install them by  
# running the following commands: install.packages("ggplot2") and 
# install.packages("magrittr")
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)

### 2. Source each other's files
source('CodeMeilin.R')

### 3. Choose the data set

# See all the R core data sets available
data() 

# Load the core data set called women
data(women) 

### 4. Look at the data set
?women

# Look at the names of the variables in the data set
names(women) 

#  To look at the first 6 observations (in a table)
head(women) 

### 5. Descriptive Statistics

### Given that the data set looks at the average heights and weights
### for American women aged 30 to 39, it is worth looking at the following
### descriptive statistics: frequency (histrograms), mean, median, quartiles 
### and interquartile ranges, range, variance and standard deviation, boxplots
### and distribution plots. I additionally plotted the variables to look at the
### relationship between them. 


# 5.1 Histograms
hist(women$height, xlab = "Height (in)")
hist(women$weight, xlab = "Weight (lb)")

# 5.2 Plot variables to observe potential links
plot(women, xlab = "Height (in)", ylab = "Weight (lb)",
     main = "Height-weight ratio for American women aged 30-39")

# 5.2 Mean
mean (women$height)
mean (women$weight)

# 3. Median
median(women$height)
median(women$weight)

# 4. Quartiles and interquartile ranges 
summary(women$height)
summary(women$weight)
IQR(women$height)
IQR(women$weight)

# 5. Range
range(women$height)
range(women$weight)

# 6. Variance
var(women$height)
var(women$weight)

# 7. Standard deviation
sd(women$height)
sd(women$weight)

#  8. Boxplots
boxplot(women$height, main = 'Height')
boxplot(women$weight, main = 'Weight')

# 9. Summarise with loess
ggplot2::ggplot(women, aes(weight, height)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw()
